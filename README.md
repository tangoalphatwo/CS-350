# CS-350

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

The two chosen projects are the final project containing the gpiointerrupt.c file and the uartecho.c file. The UART project is meant to blink an LED on or off depending on an input prompt. The GPIO Interrupt project is the culmination of the course and demonstrates a full understanding of the course material. This project is meant to take in input from a sensor and compare it to a preprogrammed variable. Depending on the comparison an LED is meant to switch on or off. The value of this programmed variable is also able to be changed with the pressing of a button.

What did you do particularly well?

The reason I selected these two files is that I received a compliment on the UART project for its succinctness and the gpiointerrupt file as it is a very complex project that demonstrates a multitude of skills in the C programming language.

Where could you improve?

I have to be quite honest and admit I am not sure where I could improve. If I knew, I would have done so. I am not saying there isn't room to improve, however, I am unaware of what I could have done to improve my project. I programmed both of these projects as well as I could have, taking as much time at the beginning of each assignment to ensure time management was not a cause for an inefficient project.

What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?

The GPIO Interrupt project was the hardest project I have completed so far. Because of this, I am glad for this class. I will absolutely use what I have learned from this class and add it to my knowledge base. I also have a better understanding of the relationship between software and hardware. I can definitely see myself working in a field integrating the two and will add that to the list of interests for future career ideas.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or coursework?

I definitely have a better grasp of the C programming language because of this class. Being forced to carry some of my other programming language knowledge into C has made me a better programmer overall.

How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Maintainable code is code that essentially transfers over well. Code that is simple and can easily be converted to other uses. WHil I am not quite sure how to use this code in future projects at the moment, I definitely used some of the same concepts between projects and even referred back to the previous module's code while working on the GPIO Interrupt project. This is something I am sure I will refer back to at some point in the future.
